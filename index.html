        <!-- <p> text still takes 7 lines instead of 6 and all texts are noticably bolder than ones provided on the mockup.jpg. I don't know if its intended. Tried playing with font-weight & font-size in style.css, but font-weight doesn't help. Font-size makes <p> text noticably smaller if fitted in 6 lanes. The only other thing that comes to mind is to change the font, but its specifically defined. And css wasn't touched in curriculum yet, so, guess, I'll leave it as is. Wonder if somebody will ever read this comment.  <3 :) -->
